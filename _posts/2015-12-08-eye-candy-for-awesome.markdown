Here I'm trying to list steps I made to turn my awesome WM into eye candy. 

First, let's deal with GTK theme. I prefer dark working environments, so i picked up [Ambiance Blackout Flat theme](http://www.ravefinity.com/p/download-ambiance-blackout-flat-colors.html) and installed it in a usual way [described here](http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Customizing_GTK_Apps). 

As an icon set I've installed [AwOken by alecive](http://alecive.deviantart.com/art/AwOken-163570862) from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/awoken-icons)


P.S. I'm still writing this, since i'm customizing my WM right now
