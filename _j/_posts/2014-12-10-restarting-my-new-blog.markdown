Hey, what's up! Welcome to my new blog. Here i will write in english against my tumblr-blog. 
Right here i would like to share my knowledge of technologies. A little "about me" can be found on top page of [this site].

A little info about projects i am working on. 

* The first is a 'GameOne' - a computer game that is in active development state. Main goal of this project is to develop a game engine (along with game). This game engine will be released as open source project. Name of project is a subject to change. 
* LAIR - Limited Artificial Intelligence Realization. AI is a big field of my interests so i am playing with this project to learn and understand more about AIs. Once i'm get close to version that can do anything interesting, i will publish the source codes.
* [AltynAI] - is a home automation system. I am just started on that, but one of my hobbies is electronics, so this project is half on software and half on hardware.

So basically i will write posts about those projects.
